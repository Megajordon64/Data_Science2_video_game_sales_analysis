__Comments:__ Really good job!! All required part of the analysis were presents and included thoughtfulness at each level. I was impressed by the plot customization in your EDA section. 
I also enjoyed your reflection and analysis at the end of the documents. There were only one or two parts that concerned me. You still aren't checking the same assumptions of linear regression 
that we talked about in class. Also, some of your code wasn't from the tidyverse (primarily the training and testing data split). Don't use "outside" functions.

Not something I took points off for, but you should try to intersperse comments with plots and analysis. Having a large chunk of plots, etc. and then comments at the end make it harder to follow the analysis.
